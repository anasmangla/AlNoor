# Privacy Policy

_Last updated: 2025-09-15_

Al Noor Farm LLC ("Al Noor Farm," "we," "us," or "our") respects your privacy and is committed to protecting the personal information we collect through our website, mobile experiences, point-of-sale systems, and any related services (collectively, the "Services"). This Privacy Policy describes the information we collect, how we use it, and the choices you have regarding your data.

## 1. Information We Collect
We collect the following categories of information when you interact with the Services:

### 1.1 Information You Provide Directly
- Contact details, such as your name, email address, phone number, billing and shipping addresses.
- Account credentials, including usernames and hashed passwords.
- Order details, preferences, and special instructions (for example, requested cut style, target hanging weight, or halal certification requirements).
- Payment information (processed by our payment processors) and transaction history.
- Communications you send to us, including support inquiries, product reviews, or feedback surveys.

### 1.2 Information Collected Automatically
- Device and usage information, including IP address, browser type, operating system, referring URLs, and pages viewed.
- Analytics data about interactions with our storefront, checkout, and marketing campaigns.
- Location information when you enable location services or share an address for delivery or pickup scheduling.

### 1.3 Information from Third Parties
- Identity or eligibility data provided by payment processors, fraud-prevention partners, or marketing platforms.
- Fulfillment updates from processors, distributors, or partner farms that confirm harvest dates, halal status, or delivery milestones.
- Publicly available information or data obtained from social media interactions if you engage with our accounts.

**Meat Weight and Sourcing Disclaimer:** We record estimated and final packaged weights for traceability and invoicing. These measurements may vary from initial estimates because meat is a natural product and can lose moisture during processing. Sourcing notes (such as farm of origin or processor) may change when supply chain circumstances require substitutions. We maintain these records to comply with food safety, halal certification, and labeling requirements, but exact weights and suppliers can shift without prior notice.

## 2. How We Use Information
We use the information we collect for the following purposes:
- Processing and fulfilling orders, including communicating with you about order status, delivery updates, and product availability.
- Managing your account, loyalty program participation, and preferences.
- Personalizing product recommendations, marketing communications, and promotions based on your interests.
- Managing inventory, forecasting demand, and ensuring sourcing traceability for meat and specialty products.
- Complying with legal obligations, including food safety regulations, tax requirements, and halal certification audits.
- Detecting, investigating, and preventing fraud, abuse, or security incidents.
- Analyzing usage trends to improve the Services, develop new offerings, and enhance user experience.

## 3. Cookies and Similar Technologies
We use cookies, web beacons, pixels, and similar tracking technologies to:
- Remember your preferences and session information.
- Understand how the Services are used and measure marketing campaign effectiveness.
- Provide relevant advertising on our Services and on third-party sites.

You can configure your browser to reject cookies or alert you when cookies are set. If you disable cookies, some features of the Services may not function correctly.

## 4. How We Share Information
We may share information in the following circumstances:
- With payment processors, financial institutions, and fraud-prevention providers to complete transactions and secure payments.
- With logistics companies, cold-chain couriers, and in-store pickup partners to deliver your orders.
- With partner farms, slaughterhouses, and processors to verify sourcing, halal compliance, and quality standards. These partners receive only the information necessary to fulfill your order (for example, cut specifications and target weight ranges) and may update us with actual packaged weights that differ from the estimate.
- With marketing and analytics service providers who help us promote the Services and understand customer engagement.
- With professional advisors (such as legal counsel, accountants, or auditors) when needed to operate our business responsibly.
- In connection with a business transaction, such as a merger, acquisition, or asset sale, subject to appropriate confidentiality protections.
- When required by law, regulation, or legal process, or to protect the rights, property, or safety of Al Noor Farm, our customers, or others.

We do not sell your personal information for monetary consideration. We may share aggregated or de-identified data (such as total pounds sold by cut) that no longer identifies you for business analytics, marketing insights, or to communicate sourcing transparency to customers and partners.

## 5. Payment Processing
We rely on trusted third-party payment processors to handle card transactions. Your card details are transmitted directly to those processors and are not stored on our servers. We receive confirmation of payment status to complete your order.

## 6. Data Retention
We retain your information for as long as necessary to provide the Services, comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes, enforce agreements, and maintain accurate meat sourcing and weight records required by regulators or certification bodies. When information is no longer needed, we securely delete or anonymize it.

## 7. Your Choices and Rights
Depending on your location, you may have the right to:
- Access, correct, or delete personal information we hold about you.
- Object to or restrict certain processing activities.
- Withdraw consent where we rely on consent (for example, for marketing communications).
- Opt out of receiving marketing emails by following the unsubscribe link in each email or by contacting us.

To exercise your rights, contact us using the details in the "Contact Us" section below. We may need to verify your identity before fulfilling your request. Certain information may be exempt from deletion if retention is required by law or to support ongoing business operations (such as outstanding invoices or documented meat sourcing records).

## 8. Security
We implement administrative, technical, and physical safeguards designed to protect personal information against unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. Despite our efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.

## 9. Children's Privacy
The Services are not directed to children under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If we become aware that a child has provided personal information, we will take steps to delete such information promptly. Parents or guardians who believe their child has provided us with personal information should contact us immediately.

## 10. International Data Transfers
If you access the Services from outside the United States, be aware that your information may be transferred to, stored in, and processed in the United States or other countries where we operate. Those locations may have data protection laws that differ from those in your jurisdiction. We will take appropriate measures to ensure that transfers comply with applicable data protection laws.

## 11. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in our practices, technology, or legal requirements. The "Last updated" date above indicates when the policy was most recently revised. Material changes will be communicated through the Services, email notification, or other reasonable means. Your continued use of the Services after the effective date of any updates constitutes acceptance of the revised policy.
