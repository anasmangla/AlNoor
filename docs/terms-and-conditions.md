_Last updated: 2025-09-15_

## 1. Overview
Al Noor Farm LLC ("Al Noor Farm," "we," "us," or "our") operates the Al Noor Farm website, point-of-sale systems, and any related online or offline services (collectively, the "Services"). These Terms and Conditions (the "Terms") govern your access to and use of the Services, including any purchase of meat, poultry, grocery, or prepared food products (the "Products").

## 2. Acceptance of Terms
By accessing or using the Services, creating an account, or placing an order, you agree to be bound by these Terms and any policies referenced herein, including our Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with these Terms, do not use the Services.

## 3. Eligibility and Account Responsibilities
- You must be at least 18 years old and capable of entering into a binding agreement to use the Services.
- You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account credentials and for all activities that occur under your account.
- You must promptly notify us of any unauthorized use of your account or breach of security.

## 4. Orders and Payment
- Orders placed through the Services constitute an offer to purchase Products. We may accept or reject any order in our sole discretion.
- Prices are listed in U.S. dollars and, unless otherwise noted, exclude applicable taxes, shipping, handling, and delivery fees.
- We accept payment methods disclosed at checkout. By submitting payment information, you represent that you are authorized to use the selected payment method and authorize us to charge the order total to that method.
- Custom or bulk orders may require a deposit. Final payment is due when the order is fulfilled.

## 5. Pricing, Availability, and Substitutions
- Product availability is subject to change without notice. We reserve the right to discontinue or limit quantities of any Product at any time.
- We may substitute comparable cuts or products of equal or greater value to fulfill your order if the original item becomes unavailable. We will notify you of material substitutions and provide an option to cancel or adjust the order.
- Promotions, discounts, and coupons may be subject to additional terms. Unless otherwise specified, offers cannot be combined.

## 6. Product Information, Meat Weights, and Sourcing Disclaimers
- We strive to describe Products accurately, including cut, grade, halal certifications, and sourcing information. However, natural variation in livestock, processing methods, and seasonal availability mean that final characteristics may differ slightly from photographs or descriptions.
- **Meat weights are approximate and provided for guidance.** Unless explicitly stated, weights are recorded prior to trimming, deboning, or cooking and may vary by up to several ounces or pounds depending on the cut. Final invoiced price may reflect the exact weight packaged or delivered.
- Due to natural moisture loss, dry aging, or processing requirements, packaged weight may be lower than the carcass or hanging weight quoted during ordering. You agree that such variations do not constitute nonconformity or grounds for rejection.
- **Sourcing information is accurate to the best of our knowledge at the time of listing but may change based on farm availability, animal health, or regulatory requirements.** We reserve the right to procure livestock or meat from alternative farms or processors that meet our halal, quality, and safety standards. When sourcing changes affect certification or origin claims, we will use reasonable efforts to inform you before fulfillment.
- Cooking, storage, and handling instructions are recommendations only. You are responsible for verifying doneness, food safety, and suitability for dietary needs.

## 7. Shipping, Delivery, and Pickup
- Delivery areas, time frames, and fees are displayed at checkout. Delays may occur due to weather, carrier issues, or events beyond our control.
- Risk of loss transfers to you upon delivery to the address or pickup location specified in your order. Inspect Products promptly upon receipt and contact us within 24 hours if there are issues.
- You are responsible for ensuring someone is available to receive refrigerated or frozen Products at the scheduled time and for maintaining safe storage temperatures thereafter.

## 8. Returns, Refunds, and Replacements
- Perishable food Products are generally non-returnable. If you experience an issue with quality, temperature control, or packaging, contact us within 24 hours of delivery with documentation (such as photographs) so we can evaluate the request.
- When a refund or replacement is approved, we may provide store credit, a replacement shipment, or a partial/full refund to the original payment method.
- Refunds may be denied when Products were stored improperly after delivery, were altered or cooked, or when weight variations fall within the disclosed tolerances above.

## 9. Promotions, Gift Cards, and Loyalty Programs
- Promotional codes, loyalty rewards, and gift cards are subject to the specific terms presented with the offer. Unless otherwise stated, they are not redeemable for cash, cannot be transferred, and may expire.
- We may suspend or terminate a promotion or loyalty program at any time for any reason, including suspected fraud or abuse.

## 10. Intellectual Property
- All trademarks, logos, service marks, product names, photographs, recipes, and other content displayed through the Services are owned by or licensed to Al Noor Farm.
- You may not copy, reproduce, distribute, modify, create derivative works from, publicly display, or exploit any portion of the Services without our prior written consent, except as permitted by law for personal, non-commercial use.

## 11. Third-Party Services and Links
The Services may contain links to third-party websites or integrate with third-party tools (such as payment processors or delivery partners). We do not control and are not responsible for the content or privacy practices of those third parties. Your interactions with third parties are governed by their respective terms and policies.

## 12. Disclaimer of Warranties
THE SERVICES AND PRODUCTS ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY. WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, WE DISCLAIM ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. NATURAL VARIATIONS IN MEAT WEIGHT, COLOR, MARBLING, OR TEXTURE DO NOT CONSTITUTE DEFECTS OR BREACHES OF WARRANTY.

## 13. Limitation of Liability
TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, AL NOOR FARM AND ITS DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, OR SUPPLIERS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR FOR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS OR REVENUES, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE SERVICES OR PRODUCTS. OUR TOTAL LIABILITY FOR ANY CLAIM SHALL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNT YOU PAID FOR THE ORDER THAT GAVE RISE TO THE CLAIM.

## 14. Indemnification
You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Al Noor Farm, its affiliates, officers, directors, employees, and agents from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, or expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising out of or in any way connected with your use of the Services, violation of these Terms, or infringement of any third-party rights.

## 15. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution
These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of New York, without regard to its conflict-of-law principles, unless the law of your jurisdiction requires otherwise. Any dispute arising under or relating to the Services shall be resolved through good-faith negotiations. If not resolved, the parties agree to submit the dispute to mediation before pursuing litigation or arbitration, except where injunctive relief is sought to prevent irreparable harm.
