# Al Noor Farm – Website and POS Overview

## Introduction
We are building a custom website and point‑of‑sale (POS) system for Al Noor Farm. It aims to be simple, connect online and in‑store sales, and gradually replace the current Square setup.

## Public Website – Browse and Buy
The site will list products (halal meats, eggs, other goods) with photos, descriptions, and prices. Customers can add to cart and purchase online at their convenience. Clear categories and product pages make browsing easy for all users.

## Online Ordering and Secure Card Payment
Customers can pay online by credit/debit card through a secure, familiar checkout. After payment, customers get confirmation and you receive instant order notifications. A fast, low‑friction checkout improves customer satisfaction and retention (see: https://checkoutchamp.com/).

## Admin Dashboard – Manage Products and Inventory
A private admin area lets authorized staff add/edit products, prices, and stock without technical steps. Changes immediately reflect on the public site, avoiding double entry (see: https://makewebbetter.com/). Inventory updates in real time as sales occur, reducing overselling and manual errors (see: https://litextension.com/).

## In‑Store Checkout (POS)
The POS provides a quick, tailored checkout on a tablet or computer. Scan barcodes or select from a quick‑pick menu, and the system calculates totals, taxes, and discounts. Accept cash and cards (with a compatible reader). Each sale updates inventory instantly and can email or print receipts.

## Sync with Square (Transition Plan)
Where feasible, we will integrate with Square’s APIs/SDKs so you can keep using Square hardware and see transactions in Square while also recording them in the new system (see: https://squareup.com/). If full real‑time sync is not possible, we’ll provide fallback exports/imports.

## Benefits
- Faster checkout online and in‑store → happier, repeat customers (see: https://checkoutchamp.com/)
- Unified inventory → fewer errors and no double entry (see: https://litextension.com/, https://makewebbetter.com/)
- Simple management and unified reporting → one source of truth for products, stock, and sales

## Visitor Feedback & Analytics
- A short, optional survey on the home page captures first impressions from new visitors.
- Admins can review submissions and see quarterly trends in the dashboard to prioritize updates.
- Schedule a quarterly analytics review to align merchandising, promotions, and content with what visitors are asking for most.

## Conclusion
The integrated storefront and POS deliver fast checkout, accurate inventory, and simple daily operations. With Square integration where possible, the transition will be smooth and familiar while adding the flexibility of a custom system.
