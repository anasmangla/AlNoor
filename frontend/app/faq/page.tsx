                <p>
                    Every goat, lamb, and chicken is raised on our Ransomville pastures or sourced from partner farms within 50
                    miles that follow the same zabihah standards. Animals are processed on-site under the supervision of our
                    halal compliance team so Buffalo, Lewiston, and Niagara Falls families know exactly where their meat comes
                    from.

            <>
                <p>
                    We recite the Tasmiya for each animal, use dedicated blades that are sharpened between uses, and ensure
                    animals face the qibla during processing. The workflow is documented in a compliance log reviewed by our
                    halal advisory council. You can observe the process during open barn hours or schedule a private walkthrough.

                <p>
                    Yes. Most families pick up orders directly from the farm in Ransomville, but we also coordinate meetups in
                    Niagara Falls, Lewiston, and North Tonawanda on Thursdays. Limited home delivery is available within Buffalo
                    city limits for bulk ordersâ€”contact us a week in advance so we can plan refrigerated transport.

                <p>
                    Submit the contact form with your preferred date, weight range, and pickup location. We require a 30% deposit
                    to hold the animal. Confirmation emails include preparation notes, zabihah certification details, and tips on
                    storing your halal meat after pickup.

                <p>
                    Absolutely. Our team can quarter or eighth a goat, grind beef or lamb for kofta, and package chicken pieces to
                    match your recipe plans. Let us know if you need freezer-ready vacuum sealing or if you plan to cook
                    immediately for a community event in Buffalo or Niagara Falls.

                    Availability shifts with the farming calendar. Spring features goat kids and pasture-raised chickens, summer
                    brings lamb sausages and yogurt parfaits, and fall focuses on hearty beef and root-vegetable boxes. Check the

                <p>
                    Yes. We host guided tours on the last Sunday of each month and can accommodate school groups, mosque youth
                    programs, and culinary classes. Tours include a halal process overview, time with the animals, and a Q&A with
                    our farmers. Advance registration is recommended during peak summer weekends.
